# Employee Payroll System

This project implements a simple Employee Payroll System in Java. It consists of classes to represent different types of employees (Full-time and Part-time) and a PayrollSystem class to manage the list of employees.

## Features

- **Employee**: An abstract class representing basic attributes and behaviors of an employee such as name, ID, and salary calculation. It has two concrete subclasses: FullTimeEmployee and PartTimeEmployee.

- **FullTimeEmployee**: Represents a full-time employee with a fixed monthly salary.

- **PartTimeEmployee**: Represents a part-time employee whose salary is calculated based on the number of hours worked and the hourly rate.

- **PayrollSystem**: Manages the list of employees, allowing addition, removal, and display of employee details.

## Usage

1. **Compilation**: Compile the Java files using a Java compiler.

2. **Execution**: Run the compiled Main class.
